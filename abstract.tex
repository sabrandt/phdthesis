Measurements of \W and \Z boson production in \pp collisions at \sg and \sh are presented. Final states are electron and muon channels, from data colleted by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The corresponding integrated luminosity for the data is \lumig (\sg) and \lumih (\sh). The measured inclusive cross section time branching fraction for \sg are: \\
$\sbrwp(\wlp) = \xsIncWlpG$,\\
$\sbrwm(\wlm) = \xsIncWlmG$,\\
$\sbrw(\wlnu) = \xsIncWlG$,~and\\ 
$\sbrz(\zll) = \xsIncZllG$\\
The measured inclusive cross section times branching fractions for \sh are:\\
$\sbrwp(\wlp) = \xsIncWlpH$,\\
$\sbrwm(\wlm) = \xsIncWlmH$,\\
$\sbrw(\wlnu) = \xsIncWlH$,~and\\ 
$\sbrz(\zll) = \xsIncZllH$\\
The \Wp and \Wm cross sections are for $\mt > 40 \GeV$ and the \Z cross sections are for dilepton mass in the range \masswindow. Cross sections and ratios of cross sections are reported.
