\chapter{Summary}
Precision measurements in the electron and muon channels at \sg and \sh are performed for the:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \Wp boson cross section
    \item \Wm boson cross section
    \item \W boson cross section
    \item $\Wp/\Wm$ cross section ratio
    \item \Z boson cross section
    \item $\Wp/\Z$ cross section ratio
    \item $\Wm/\Z$ cross section ratio
    \item $\W/\Z$ cross section ratio
\end{itemize}
% as well as the ratio of the \sg/\sh cross section measurements. Results are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:final:xs}.
%% generic description
Events were selected from well-identified and isolated electrons and muons. Candidate \Z boson events required two oppositely charged leptons of the same flavor, and \W boson events required the presence of a well-identified and isolated lepton with no other leptons reconstructed in the event.
%% corrections & uncertainties
Lepton reconstruction and identification efficiency corrections were derived by the tag-and-probe method from \zee and \zmm samples. Hadronic recoil corrections were derived from \zmm in data and simulation and \wmunu simulation, to improve \met modeling. Additionally, ECAL L1 prefiring efficiency corrections and lepton momentum scale and resolution corrections were applied. Uncertainties associated with these corrections were propagated from the physical observables to the final discriminant distribution. Uncertainties on theoretical calculations from higher-order QCD, NNLO QCD, NNLL resummation, and NLO EWK are also determined.
%% fitting % results
Final yields and cross section values were determined by performing a fit simultaneously to the \Wp, \Wm, and \Z boson channels. Uncertainties in observable distributions, uncertainties in normalizations, and background process normalizations were correlated in all channels where appropriate.

The measured cross sections show good agreement between the electron and muon channels at each \s. The measured cross section value for \Wp, \Wm, \W, and \Z boson channels depends on the total integrated luminosity for the dataset, and due to the preliminary luminosity calibration the \sg and \sh cross sections cannot be meaningfully compared. However, the ratios $\Wp/\Wm$, $\Wp/\Z$, $\Wp/\Z$, $\W/\Z$ are independent of the luminosity measurement. These are consistent for both electron and muon channels and both \sg and \sh. 

Cross section measurements of \W and \Z bosons provide insight into some of the proton PDFs. $\Wp/\Wm$ ratios are sensitive to the valence $u$ and $d$ PDFs, and $\W/\Z$ ratios are additionally sensitive to heavier flavor PDFs such as $s$.
