\chapter{Summary}
Precision measurements in the electron and muon channels at \sg and \sh are performed for the:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \Wp boson cross section
    \item \Wm boson cross section
    \item \W boson cross section
    \item $\Wp/\Wm$ cross section ratio
    \item \Z boson cross section
    \item $\Wp/\Z$ cross section ratio
    \item $\Wm/\Z$ cross section ratio
    \item $\W/\Z$ cross section ratio
\end{itemize}
as well as the ratio of the \sg/\sh Results are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:final:xs}.
