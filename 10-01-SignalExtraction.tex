\section{Fit Model}\label{ch:sig:fit}
The cross sections of the \Wpm and \Z bosons are determined by a simultaneous fit of \Wp, \Wm, and \Z boson channels. Modeled observable distributions of \Wp, \Wm, and \Z boson signals and associated backgrounds are fit to their respective observable distribution in data. The discriminant for the \Wp and \Wm bosons is the transverse mass (\mt) observable, and for \Z bosons is the dilepton invariant mass \mll. Equation~\ref{eq:mt} shows the definition of \mt.
\begin{equation}
\mt = \sqrt{ 2 \pt^{\ell} \met ( 1 - \cos[\Delta\phi( {\vec \ell},\met ) ] ) }
\label{eq:mt}
\end{equation}
The \mll and \mt distributions for the \Wp, \Wm, and \Z boson signal processes as well as their backgrounds are modeled as described in the following section. 
The full fit model consists of the \Wp, \Wm, and \Z boson signal models, the diboson background, the \ttbar background, the Drell-Yan background, and the $W$+jets background. The \Wp and \Wm boson channels also include a QCD background. All signal and background models include the appropriate correction, which affect the discriminant distribution and overall normalizations. Detailed descriptions of the background processes and modeling are provided in the next section, the remainder of this section describes how these are incorporated into the  fit. 
\subsubsection{Normalizations}
Signal process normalizations are independent across channels. Within a given channel, the signal process and background process from the same production mechanism (i.e. \wmunu and \wtau) have their rates fixed relative to each other. The \ttbar normalizations and diboson normalizations are fully correlated across the \Wp, \Wm, and \Z boson channels. Uncertainties on the normalizations of each of these processes is set to $10\%$. The Drell-Yan background normalization is correlated between the \Wp and \Wm channels, with a normalization uncertainty of $3\%$. The luminosity uncertainty on the normalizations of all simulated processes is fully correlated for all simulated processes in all channels. 

\subsubsection{Shape Uncertainties}
Uncertainties on observables which impact the final discriminant distribution are included as shape uncertainties. Prefiring correction uncertainties are fully correlated for all simulated processes in the \Wp, \Wm, and \Z boson channels. Each uncertainty source from the lepton efficiency scale factors is also correlated over all simulated processes in all channels. Each uncertainty due to recoil/\met modeling is fully correlated across the \W signal and \W and \Z background processes in the \Wp and \Wm channels. The QCD-multijet background uncertainty is correlated between the \Wp and \Wm channels.

\section{Background Modeling}\label{ch:sig:bkg}
Backgrounds are estimated from both simulation and data-driven sources. Simulated backgrounds include the \ttbar and various electroweak processes, and include the appropriate normalization factors for prefiring and efficiency. Backgrounds to \W and \Z can include \ttbar and diboson ($WW$, $WZ$, $ZZ$) processes contributing one or two isolated leptons, respectively. The DY background to the \W is from a \zmm or \zee decay with only one lepton being in the detector volume, or the \ztt with one of the $\tau$ decaying leptonically. \ztt with leptonic $\tau$ decays is also a background to the \Z. The \wtaunu, with leptonic $\tau$ decay also contributes to the \W backgrounds.

 
\subsubsection{QCD Background}\label{ch:w:qcd}
The largest background of the \wlnu lepton + \met signature is from QCD multijet background. The primary contributions are heavy-flavor decays and $\gamma$+jets with photon conversion to electrons. 
There are no simulations of the QCD background available for the datasets used in this analysis, therefore a data-driven method of estimating the \mt distribution from QCD sources is used. A QCD-enriched region composed of non-isolated leptons is obtained from data by inverting the lepton isolation criteria in the lepton ID cuts and subtracting the expected \mt distributions described by simulation due to \W signal and other background processes. The QCD multijet background \mt distribution is taken from the $0.30 < \mathrm{Iso} < 0.45$ control region. The region $0.15 < \mathrm{Iso} < 0.30$ is excluded due to high levels of \W signal contamination (approx 30\% \W). The \mt distributions are generally stable over different isolation ranges.


\section{Uncertainties}\label{ch:unc}
Uncertainties on corrections are propaged to the final obserable distributions \mt and \mll. These include variations on the lepton momentum scale factors, recoil corrections, prefiring probability, and lepton efficiency.
An uncertainty on the QCD multijet shape due to the choice of control region is estimated by using an second isolation range and taking the difference as the shape uncertainty. The main QCD \mt shape is from the $0.30 < \mathrm{Iso} < 0.45$ region, and the shape uncertainty is derived from the difference with respect to the \mt distribution in $0.45 < \mathrm{Iso} < 0.60$.

\section{Summary}

The observed yields resulting from the signal extraction fits for all signal and background processes are listed in Table~\ref{tab:yield:ele:5} (Table~\ref{tab:yield:ele:13}) for the electron channels and Table~\ref{tab:yield:mu:5} (Table~\ref{tab:yield:mu:13}) for the muon channels at \serag (\serah). Quoted uncertainties include both statistical and systematic sources.

Figures showing the \Zmm and \Zee \mll distributions are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:z:z:5} for \serag and Figure~\ref{fig:z:z:13} for \serah. Distributions of \mt for \W fits are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:signal_wp} for \Wp and Figure~\ref{fig:signal_wm} for \Wm.
