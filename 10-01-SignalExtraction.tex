\section{Fit Model}\label{ch:sig:fit}
The cross sections of the \Wpm and \Z bosons are determined by a simultaneous fit of \Wp, \Wm, and \Z boson channels. Modeled observable distributions of \Wp, \Wm, and \Z boson signals and associated backgrounds are fit to their respective observable distribution in data. The discriminant for the \Wp and \Wm bosons is the transverse mass (\mt) observable, and for \Z bosons is the dilepton invariant mass \mll. Equation~\ref{eq:mt} shows the definition of \mt.
\begin{equation}
\mt = \sqrt{ 2 \pt^{\ell} \met ( 1 - \cos[\Delta\phi( {\vec \ell},\met ) ] ) }
\label{eq:mt}
\end{equation}
The \mll and \mt distributions for the \Wp, \Wm, and \Z boson signal processes as well as their backgrounds are modeled as described in the following section. 
The full fit model consists of the \Wp, \Wm, and \Z boson signal models, the diboson background, the \ttbar background, the Drell-Yan background, and the $W$+jets background. The \Wp and \Wm boson channels also include a QCD background. All signal and background models include the appropriate correction, which affect the discriminant distribution and overall normalizations. Detailed descriptions of the background processes and modeling are provided in the next section, the remainder of this section describes how these are incorporated into the  fit. 
\subsubsection{Normalizations}
Signal process normalizations are independent across channels. Within a given channel, the signal process and background process from the same production mechanism (i.e. \wmunu and \wtau) have their rates fixed relative to each other. The \ttbar normalizations and diboson normalizations are fully correlated across the \Wp, \Wm, and \Z boson channels. Uncertainties in the normalizations of each of these processes is set to $10\%$. The Drell-Yan background normalization is correlated between the \Wp and \Wm boson channels, with a normalization uncertainty of $3\%$. QCD background normalization in the \Wp and \Wm boson channels are independent and unconstrained. The luminosity uncertainty in the normalizations of all simulated processes is fully correlated for all simulated processes in all channels. 

\subsubsection{Shape Uncertainties}
Uncertainties in observables which impact the final discriminant distribution are included as shape uncertainties. Prefiring correction uncertainties are fully correlated for all simulated processes in the \Wp, \Wm, and \Z boson channels. Each uncertainty source from the lepton efficiency scale factors is also correlated over all simulated processes in all channels. Each uncertainty due to recoil/\met modeling is fully correlated across the \W boson signal and \W and \Z boson background processes in the \Wp and \Wm boson channels. The QCD-multijet background uncertainty is correlated between the \Wp and \Wm channels.

\section{Signal Modeling}\label{ch:sig:sig}
The \Z boson and \Wp and \Wm boson signal processes are described by simulation, and include several corrections to improve simulated descriptions of effects seen in data. Lepton momentum scale corrections (Chapter~\ref{ch:corrs}), lepton reconstruction and identification efficiency scale factors (Chapter~\ref{ch:eff}), and prefiring corrections (Chapter~\ref{ch:prefire}) are applied for all of the \Wp, \Wm, and \Z boson processes. The \Wp and \Wm boson processes additionally include \met corrections, which are described in Chapter~\ref{ch:recoil}. Disriminants---\mll for the \Z boson and \mt for the \Wp and \Wm bosons---are calculated after all corrections to kinematic observables have been applied, and appropriate event weighting is included when constructing the distributions.

\section{Background Modeling}\label{ch:sig:bkg}
Backgrounds are estimated from both simulation and data-driven sources. Simulated backgrounds include the \ttbar and various electroweak processes, and include the appropriate normalization factors for prefiring and efficiency. Backgrounds to \W and \Z boson can include \ttbar and diboson ($WW$, $WZ$, $ZZ$) processes contributing one or two isolated leptons, respectively. The DY background to the \W is from a \zmm or \zee decay with only one lepton being in the detector volume, or the \ztt with one of the $\tau$ decaying leptonically. \ztt with leptonic $\tau$ decays is also a background to the \Z. The \wtau, with leptonic $\tau$ decay also contributes to the \W backgrounds.
For all of these simulated background processes, lepton efficiency scale factors, lepton momentum scale corrections, and prefiring corrections are applied when producing the \mt and \mll distributions. Additionally, the \wtau and Drell-Yan background processes in the \Wp and \Wm boson channels include \met corrections.

 
\subsubsection{QCD Background}\label{ch:w:qcd}
The largest background of the \W is from QCD multijet background. The primary contributions are heavy-flavor decays and $\gamma$+jets with photon conversion to electrons. There are no reliable simulations available to describe this process, therefore the QCD  \mt distribution is estimated from data. This background region is composed of events passing the standard lepton identification and event selection requirements, with the relative isolation criteria inverted. Contributions from electroweak processes are subtracted. The shape of the QCD \mt distribution in the non-isolated lepton control region is assumed to be the same as in the signal region. Multiple isolation regions are considered when constructing the QCD background contribution. Three regions, $0.15 < I < 0.30$, $0.30 < I < 0.45$, and $0.45 < I < 0.55$ are considered. These are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:INSERT}, and the \mt distribution is found to be generally independent of isolation region. Due to the high \W boson signal contamination (about $30\%$), the $0.15 < I < 0.30$ region is not considered when constructing the QCD \mt distribution. The primary QCD \mt distribution is taken from the $0.30 < I < 0.45$ region, which has around $5\%$ \W boson signal contamination. An uncertainty in the QCD estimation is taken from the relative difference between the \mt shapes in the $0.30 < I < 0.45$ and $0.45 < I < 0.55$ regions. The uncertainty is symmetrized around the central value.

\section{Uncertainties}\label{ch:unc}
Uncertainties in corrections are propagated to the final observable distributions \mt and \mll. These include variations on the lepton momentum scale factors, recoil corrections, prefiring probability, and lepton efficiency.
An uncertainty in the QCD multijet shape due to the choice of control region is estimated by using an second isolation range and taking the difference as the shape uncertainty. The main QCD \mt shape is from the $0.30 < \mathrm{Iso} < 0.45$ region, and the shape uncertainty is derived from the difference with respect to the \mt distribution in $0.45 < \mathrm{Iso} < 0.60$.

\section{Summary}

The observed yields resulting from the signal extraction fits for all signal and background processes are listed in Table~\ref{tab:yield:ele:5} (Table~\ref{tab:yield:ele:13}) for the electron channels and Table~\ref{tab:yield:mu:5} (Table~\ref{tab:yield:mu:13}) for the muon channels at \sg (\sh). Quoted uncertainties include both statistical and systematic sources. The \Z boson \mll distributions are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:z:z:5} for \sg and Figure~\ref{fig:z:z:13} for \sh. The \mt distributions for the \W analyses are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:signal_wp} for \Wp and Figure~\ref{fig:signal_wm} for \Wm.
