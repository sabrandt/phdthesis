\caption{Pre-firing probability maps for photons (left) and jets (right) for 2017G (\sg). The $z-\mathrm{axis}$ represents the probability of an object with $(\pt,\eta)$ causing pre-firing. Objects with higher \pt and $|\eta| \sim 3$ are more likely to cause pre-firing. Objects with $|\eta| < 2$ do not cause pre-firing.}
