\chapter{Results}\label{ch:results}
Cross section measurements of \Wp, \Wm, \W, and \Z bosons, as well as the ratios, are presented for \sg and \sh. Electron and muon final states are studied. Data studied in this analysis includes an integrated luminosity of \lumig at \sg and \lumih at \sh. The measurement is performed with a simultaneous fit to the \Wp, \Wm, and \Z boson channels, with background processes and modeling uncertainties correlated across the appropriate channels. 

Theoretical predictions of the cross sections and ratios are provided to NNLO using FEWZ and the NNPDF3.1 and CT18 PDF sets. Contributions from both PDF and scale uncertainties are included. The \Z boson cross sections require \masswindow. A summary of the NNPDF3.1 and CT18 PDF set cross section and cross section ratio predictions is shown in Table~\ref{tab:xs:pdfs}.

A summary of of the inclusive cross section times branching ratio relative to the predictions from the NNPDF3.1 PDF set for \sg electron and muon channels is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:xs:5} and for \sh in Figure~\ref{fig:xs:13}. Ratios of cross section time branching ratio with respect to the CT18 PDF set is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:xs:ct18:13} for \sh and Figure~\ref{fig:xs:ct18:5} for \sg.
